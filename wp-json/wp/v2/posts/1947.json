Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as <strong>nonprofit<\/strong> organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Weighing in at a whopping 3310g and measuring 38cm in length, the <strong>Sigma<\/strong> 500mm f\/4 DG OS HSM <strong>Sports<\/strong> is an incredibly big and heavy lens indeed, although that does include the non-removable tripod collar.<\/p><cite>JACK DANIEL&#8217;S<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h5>A privately owned<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit<br><\/li><li>Sed do eiusmod tempor&nbsp;<strong>incididunt<\/strong>&nbsp;ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.<br><\/li><li>Faucibus turpis in eu mi bibendum neque.<br><\/li><li>Neque&nbsp;<strong>aliquam<\/strong>&nbsp;vestibulum morbi blandit cursus.<br><\/li><li>Enim nulla aliquet porttitor lacus.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cooperative: Often referred to as a &#8220;co-op&#8221;, a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit.
