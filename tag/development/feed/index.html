<p>Anyone carrying on an activity that earns them a profit is doing&nbsp;business or running a business, and perhaps this is why there is a misconception that business and company is the same thing.<br>A business name <strong>structure</strong> does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for all debts incurred by the <strong>business</strong>. If the business acquires debts[,] the creditor or creditors can go after your personal possessions. A business <strong>structure</strong> does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.</p>



<p>A company on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.</p>

<p>Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as <strong>nonprofit</strong> organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.</p>



<p>A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.</p>

<p>Cooperative: Often referred to as a &#8220;co-op&#8221;, a cooperative is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a <strong>corporation</strong> in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. <strong>Cooperatives</strong> are fundamental to the <strong>ideology</strong> of economic democracy.</p>

<p>Anyone carrying on an activity that earns them a profit is doing&nbsp;business or running a business, and perhaps this is why there is a misconception that business and company is the same thing.<br>A business name <strong>structure</strong> does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for all debts incurred by the <strong>business</strong>. If the business acquires debts[,] the creditor or creditors can go after your personal possessions. A business <strong>structure</strong> does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.</p>



<p>A company on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability as well as corporate tax rates. A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner.</p>

<p>Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned. They can organize either for profit or as <strong>nonprofit</strong> organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.</p>
